## Highlights

- **chezmoi** for managing dotfiles across machines
- **Neovim** with a Lua-based config (lazy.nvim)
- **tmux** with custom status bar and session management
- **zsh** with a minimal prompt and fast plugin loading

## Philosophy

Keep it simple. Every tool earns its place. If I haven't used it in a month, it gets removed.
