It's been a while since I've written anything here. The old Gatsby-based site served me well, but it was time for a change. I wanted something simpler — a static site generator that gets out of the way and lets me focus on writing.

## Why Hugo?

A few reasons:

- **Speed** — Hugo builds are measured in milliseconds, not minutes
- **Simplicity** — No npm dependency hell, no webpack configs to debug
- **Markdown-first** — Write content, not code (unless you want to)

## What to expect

I plan to write about things I encounter in my day-to-day work:

- Automation patterns and tools
- Software engineering practices
- DevOps and infrastructure
- Occasional deep dives into interesting problems

Nothing groundbreaking — just notes from the trenches. If even one post saves someone a few hours of debugging, that's a win.

Stay tuned.
