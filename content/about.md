## Hi, I'm Illia

Staff Software Engineer at Adobe, building backend systems at scale.

I write about things that excite me — cool automations, lessons learned the hard way, and projects worth sharing.

Feel free to connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/igrybkov) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/igrybkov).
